- [ ] Split the data into validation, test and training set with 80:10:10 proportions
- [ ] Use latent factor modelling to infer the hidden ratings of the users (they are labelled as "99" in the dataset) on the training set
- [ ] Calculate the performance of the algorithm in the validation dataset by looping through the dataset without training
- [ ] Change hyper-parameters (i.e. learning rates, number of iterations etc) as needed so you can get good results
- [ ] Report the MSE on the test dataset
