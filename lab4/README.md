- [ ] Get the best bandit that you have for 10,-10 and plot the Q-values for each time step - what do you observe? 

- [ ] Once you are done, save your changes in github
	* Go inside your lab directory and do 
      * ``git add -A -v``
      * ``git commit -m <message>``
      * ``git push origin master``
