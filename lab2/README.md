
I cloned the files from "ce888",and brought the new files,
in "salaries" excersice I read the data from vehicles and did histogram for current and new fleet.
just copyed the code from the example and gave them different define.

here are the result for first exersice.

![scaterplot](./scaterplot.png?raw=true)
![histogram](./histogram.png?raw=true)
![histogram1](./histogram1.png?raw=true)

In second part :
I changed the function from mean to standard. so I got the standard of current and new datas ,
I used 10000 as the exersice number,found that the upper and lower boud of the standard deviation are always in change. 
According several times of trying. I think the current fleet is more stable.
